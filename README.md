# Motivation
- Using the socket io to get confortable with it.
- Developing fully responsive the native mobile and web app with single codebase with 100% code sharing.

# Why "not-slack"?
- I really like the Slack design and people are familiar with its UX. As I am doing it for the learning purpose only, I hope Slack won't mind it. I plan to use Slack as a reference
point for my designs and interaction. The name implies what it is, it is not the "Slack".

# Technologies
- Expo with react native web.
- Currently trying out both React navigation and react-router-native to handle the navigation, I will settle on one depending which one is better of both platforms.
- Redux for state mangement with redux-thunk for async operations.
- NodeJS, Mongodb and Socket.io on the backend.
- I plan to host the web-frontend on Now, backend on heroku and have not decided on the mobile part.
